{"name":"Uhoh","tagline":"Keep an eye on your stuff.  Find out when things go wrong.  Simple, lightweight distributed system monitoring.","body":"Why Uhoh ?\r\n----------\r\nUhoh is an application which is performs basic monitoring tasks on hosts, relaying any issues found back\r\nto a set of centralised servers.  Key features of Uhoh include:\r\n\r\n- Clients run on hosts to be monitored.\r\n- Clients perform log file, process, disk and custom monitoring tasks.\r\n- Clients fetch all of their configuration from Servers.\r\n  - No local configuration needed on hosts.\r\n- Servers collate alarms from clients.\r\n- Servers output alarm streams for other programs to consume and analyse.\r\n- Servers host a basic web alarm view user interface.\r\n- Alarms correlation is supported allowing combinations of alarms to trigger further alarms.\r\n- 100% Java & Javascript.\r\n- Really tiny installation (both Servers and Clients).\r\n\r\nI know what you're thinking - \"There are plenty of other monitoring solutions out there, so why go with Uhoh ?\".\r\nThe answer to this is really simplicity.  Very little time needs to be invested in getting Uhoh up and running\r\nso you never need to leave setting up monitoring to later date.  Uhoh doesn't get in the way of your\r\ndeployment schedule and you can think of it in a similar way to Test Driven Development -\r\n\"Monitoring Driven Deployment\" maybe ?  Keeping things lightweight and simple will encourage the use of more\r\ncomplete and robust system monitoring - resulting in increased reliability all round.\r\n\r\nGetting Started.\r\n----------------\r\nDownload the zip file and unpack onto a host suitable for use as a Server.\r\nYou should have the following folders:\r\n\r\n- src\r\n- web\r\n- clientconfigs\r\n\r\nCompile the source and create uhoh.jar:\r\n\r\njavac -d . src/com/uhoh/*.java\r\njar -cvf uhoh.jar com\r\n\r\nThe clientconfigs folder contains Client monitoring configuration files.\r\nFor a fresh installation, only the example configuration file will exist in this folder.\r\nCreate configuration files for your hosts (filenames are the hostnames) in clientconfigs.\r\n\r\nStart the Server:\r\n\r\njava -cp uhoh.jar com.uhoh.Server server.properties\r\n\r\nCopy uhoh.jar to a Client host and start as follows:\r\n\r\njava -cp uhoh.jar com.uhoh.Client 8888\r\n\r\nPoint your browser to the UI web server (http://server_host:7777/).\r\n\r\nServers use UDP broadcast to indicate their presence to Clients.  However, for environments which don't\r\nsupport UDP broadcast (eg. AWS), Clients can be provided with a comma-separated list of Server IP\r\naddresses in addition to the UDP port.  For example, to start a Client in a system with two\r\nServers at 172.31.11.1 and 172.31.11.2 use:\r\n\r\njava -cp uhoh.jar com.uhoh.Client 8888 172.31.11.1,172.31.11.2\r\n\r\n(Note that the Client will always requests its configuration from the first IP address given.)\r\n\r\nCreating a Client Configuration File.\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nThe example_client_config file provided with the base install of Uhoh contains detailed notes on how the different\r\ndirectives used for configuring log file, process, disk and custom monitoring work.\r\n\r\nAn Uhoh client will create a separate thread (known as a Schnauzer) to monitor each item it has been instructed\r\nto look at.  The only exception to this is for process monitoring where a single thread is used to monitor all processes.\r\n\r\nFor Log File Monitoring, Schauzers will consume the file - coping with files that are “rolled” (where the\r\nexisting log is copied to another name and a new log is created once the log reaches a certain size).  Lines in\r\nthe log file are matched using a regular expression and then an action is taken.  Action types available for log files are:\r\n\r\n- Send the log file line matched back to the Server.\r\n- Send a custom message back to the Server for each match.\r\n- Count how many matches there have been over a set period of time and send the number of matches to the Server at the end of the period.\r\n- Count how many matches there have been over a set period of time and sent a custom alert or the count value back to the Server if the count is outside an expected range.\r\n\r\nFor Process Monitoring, the Schnauzer will:\r\n\r\n- Send an alert back to the Server if the number of running instances of a process (identified via a regular expression) is outside a given acceptable range.\r\n\r\nThe command used to fetch the process table can be specified - eg. “ps -fe” for Linux,\r\n“tasklist.exe” for Windows, “/usr/ucb/ps -wwaux” for Solaris etc.\r\n\r\nDisk Monitoring checks periodically that the free space available for a particular filesystem or volume hasn’t exceeded a given amount.\r\n\r\nFinally, Custom Monitoring allows the Client to run a command and relay output from that command that matches a regular expression back to the Server.\r\n\r\nManaging Running Clients.\r\n-------------------------\r\nIf a Client configuration is updated, the Client will need to be told that a new configuration is available.  The simplest\r\nway to do this is just to re-start the Client, but wouldn't it be better if there was an easier way ?  Well, there is - the\r\n\"reset\" procedure.  Here's how it works:\r\n\r\n- Servers periodically check for a file called \"reset\" located in their root folder.\r\n- If this file exists, the Server will open and read the file.\r\n- For each host name listed in the file, the Server will send a \"reset\" command to the appropriate Client.\r\n  - The file should contain a new host name on each line.\r\n- The Clients which have been reset will close down their existing Schnauzers and re-request configuration from the Server.\r\n- The Server finally deletes the \"reset\" file.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, a host will need to be decommissioned.  If this host is running a Client and the Client is closed down, then\r\nthe Server will repeatedly log a \"No updates\" alert for the Client.  To prevent this happening and make the Server forget about\r\nthe Client, use a \"forget\" file, as follows:\r\n\r\n- Servers periodically check for a file called \"forget\" located in their root folder.\r\n- If this file exists, the Server will open and read the file.\r\n- For each host name listed in the file, the Server will remove the host from its internal Client watchlist.\r\n  - The file should contain a new host name on each line.\r\n\r\nThe Browser User Interface.\r\n---------------------------\r\nEach Server hosts an embedded web server which is used to serve a simple browser based user interface which can be used to view\r\ncertain types of alerts.  The user interface page lists recently active alerts divided into three severity\r\ncategories - Red, Amber and Green.  For alerts to appear in the Red section (at the top of the list) they must\r\nbe tagged with the ID RED (other tags can be included beside this tag).  Alerts tagged AMBER appear below Red and\r\nthose tagged GREEN appear below Amber.\r\n\r\nThe Server retains alerts in the web UI for a set period of time - different categories of alert are retained for different times:\r\n\r\n- Log file alerts are retained for 10 minutes.\r\n- Process alerts are retained for 65 seconds.\r\n- Disk usage and Custom alerts are retained for 125 seconds.\r\n- Idle client alerts are retained for 75 seconds.\r\n\r\nAll of these times can be configured in the server.properties file.\r\n\r\nA graph showing the number of Red, Amber and Green alarms over the last twelve hours is shown at the top of the UI\r\npage.  This gives a simple overview of recent fault history.\r\n\r\nNote that the Browser UI requires the Mootools Javascript library, Google Fonts and the Google Visualization framework, so\r\nUI users will need Internet access.\r\n\r\nLet’s Present an Example Usage Scenario for Uhoh.\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n“Amalgamated Paperclips PLC has a network of Raspberry Pi 2s, running Ubuntu Linux, which are used to control the\r\nfactory clump-presses.  Although the clump-press control software running on each of them is very reliable, it\r\nneeds to be monitored constantly so that issues logged concerning the health of the clump-presses themselves can\r\nbe captured, a clump-press minder dispatched to fix the problem, so to avoid the entire production line grinding to a halt.\r\nThree beige-box PCs, also running Ubuntu, are also deployed on the network.  One sits in the management office and the\r\nother two in the clump-press support workshop.”\r\n\r\nHere’s how the system is set up from a monitoring perspective:\r\n\r\n- Uhoh is installed on all of the Pi 2s and Clients started, listening on UDP port 8888.\r\n- The three PCs also have Uhoh installed on them and have been set up to run Uhoh Servers.\r\n- The three Servers maintain all Client configuration files and if a Client config is updated, then that config is pushed to the other two Servers such that they all stay in sync.  Once the push has been performed, a “reset” for the updated Client can be sent from one of the Servers.\r\n- Each Client config contains configuration directives to:\r\n  - Check that the clump-press minding daemon (“clumppressd”) is running.\r\n  - Check that no more than 80% of disk space is in use.\r\n  - Check the /var/log/clumppressd.log file for indications that the press being controlled hasn’t developed a fault.\r\n- Remember, if a clump-press catches fire, Uhoh will notice that its Client is no longer running and generate an alert - probably before the smell of smoke makes it to the clump-press minders.\r\n- The three Servers, of course, are all used as Web UI servers for the factory management office users and clump-press minders.\r\n- The two PCs located in the clump-press support workshop also run various other Python scripts which:\r\n  - Consume the server.log log file from the Server.\r\n  - Pick up and correlate alerts which appear in this file.\r\n  - Write messages to other log files.\r\n  - Send email alerts to support staff inboxes.\r\n- The two clump-press support workshop PCs also run Uhoh Clients themselves which monitor the Python scripts’ output logs and feed alarms back to the Servers. (Derived alarms.)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
